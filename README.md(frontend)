# CDT Front End

## Build Setup

Install the dependancies and run.

```bash
cd project-name
npm install
npm start dev
```

## Using Pm2 To Run Our App

Firt, start by running this commands to install pm2.

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

Then, run out app.

```bash
pm2 start npm -- dev
```

## Using Nginx As A Reverse Proxy For Our App

First, install nginx

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

We need to edit the nginx configuration file to connect to our app. 
Configuration file path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

```bash
server {
	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	index index.html index.htm;
	access_log /var/log/nginx/[project_domain].access.log;
	access_log /var/log/nginx/[project_domain].error.log;
	
	server_name: [project_domain];
	charset utf-8;
	client_max_body_size 32m;
	
	location / {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}
}
```

You can confirm that your configuration is correct with following command:
```bash
nginx -t
```

Now that everything is setup restart nginx and visit your site on the browser.
