# CDT Back End

## Build Setup

Install node package dependancies and php.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

We should install the latest version of php.
At least, it should be higher than 7.2
I prefer 7.3 version of PHP.

Then, we can run backend project with the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Deploy this project on ubuntu
